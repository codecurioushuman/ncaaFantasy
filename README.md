Fantasy Basketball Project:

This is a side project that I was doing to learn about web development and interacting with APIs. It uses Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to extract team and player data from a sports API https://sportsdata.io/. The free version they offer gives you more than enough to play with. When running it takes a user to a fake login page (no authentication or session established) and prompts for username and password. It then takes the user to a page with all of the NCAA College basketball logos displayed as buttons on the page. When a logo is clicked it takes the user to a page displaying all of the players first and last names that play for that team. This is not an active project for me but I had fun and learned alot from building it.
