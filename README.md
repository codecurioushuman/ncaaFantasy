Fantasy Basketball Project
This a side project that I have been working on to learn JS with MongoDB. It still needs a lot of work, but so far I am able to pull every NCAA team and display their logo on the page. Each logo is a button that can be clicked on. When clicked the user is redirected to a page that displays the players that are on that team. Eventually I intend to implement full authentication, and the user will be able to enter a team and the date of a game that they want to check the player's stats for.
